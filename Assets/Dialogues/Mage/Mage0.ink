It is time. Your destiny awaits on the other side of this portal. #speaker:Mage

I think I am ready Mage. But the demons are powerful, and no one from our village has ever returned. #speaker:Prodigy

  We have lost too many souls to those vile creatures. It is time someone stands against them.. #speaker:Mage
    But what if I fail? What if I never come back? #speaker:Prodigy
    
    Heroes are not made by succeeding at every task. They are made by facing their fears head-on, regardless of the outcome. You have the potential to do great things, but you must be brave. #speaker:Mage

 I understand, Mage. But why must it always be someone from our village? Why do you never go yourself? #speaker:Prodigy
(looking away)
I am the guardian of this village. My duty is to protect our people and ensure the safety of our land. Sending you is not a decision I make lightly, but it is necessary. You have the best chance of survival. #speaker:Mage

I will go through the portal, Mage. I will face these demons, for the sake of our village and all those who have fallen before me. #speaker:Prodigy

That is the spirit. Now, step into the portal, and let your journey begin. #speaker:Mage
