Good day, sir. I heard you wanted to speak with me. #speaker:Prodigy

Indeed, lad. I've heard about your predicament from my son. It seems you're in quite a spot of trouble. #speaker:Blacksmith

Yes, sir. I find myself needing assistance, and I was told you might be willing to help me. #speaker:Prodigy

I am willing to help you, lad. But you must understand that aiding you comes with risks. #speaker:Blacksmith

There are rumors running rampant in the village, lad. They say that you're connected with the devil, that you possess wicked powers that will unleash demons upon us.#speaker:Blacksmith
I assure you, sir, those are baseless accusations. I have done nothing but use my skills to help others. #speaker:Prodigy

I can see that, lad. But this village fears what it does not understand. And if I help you, I risk being seen as aiding the devil himself. #speaker:Blacksmith

I know, sir. I do not wish to bring harm to anyone here. #speaker:Prodigy

Very well. I will help you, but it won't be for free. I am taking a great risk, so I need compensation for my troubles. #speaker:Blacksmith

Name your price, sir. I will do whatever it takes to secure your aid. #speaker:Prodigy

The coin is not all I need, lad. I need a promise from you. A promise that you will protect this village, that you will prove these rumors wrong, and that you will use your gift for good. #speaker:Blacksmith

You have my word, sir. I will protect this village and show them the truth. I will not let you down. #speaker:Prodigy

Good. We have an agreement then. #speaker:Blacksmith

Thank you, sir. I won't forget this kindness. #speaker:Prodigy

Remember, lad, actions speak louder than words. Now go, and do what you must. #speaker:Blacksmith
