What's wrong, Annika? You seem troubled. #speaker:Prodigy

Prodigy, please, I can't let you go through that portal. It's too dangerous. You'll die for sure. #speaker:Annika

I have to prove myself, Annika. To the village, to everyone who thinks I'm nothing but a loser. If I don't do this, I'll never be worthy of you. #speaker:Prodigy

Prodigy, you don't have anything to prove to anyone. You're already worth it, just the way you are. I can't bear the thought of losing you. #speaker:Annika

Annika, I need to take this opportunity. It's my chance to change my fate, to prove that I'm capable of something great. I can't let it pass me by. #speaker:Prodigy

I understand, but I can't suppress this feeling of dread. What if something terrible happens to you? I don't want to lose you. #speaker:Annika

I promise, Annika, that I will do my best to come back to you, to prove that you were right all along. But right now, I have to believe in myself, even if it means taking a risk. #speaker:Prodigy

I can't stop you. But before you go, there's something I want to give you. #speaker:Annika

What's this? #speaker:Prodigy
 
 A stranger gave it to me not so long ago. He claimed it would bring luck with it. I hope it brings you back home safely. #speaker:Annika
 
 Thank you, Annika. I will cherish this book and keep it close to my heart. #speaker:Prodigy
 
 Please, Prodigy, remember that you're never alone. I'll be waiting for you, praying for your safe return. #speaker:Annika
 
 I couldn't ask for a better person to come home to. You've always seen the best in me, even when no one else did. Farewell. #speaker:Prodigy
