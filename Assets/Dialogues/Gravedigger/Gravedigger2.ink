Hey there, prodigy! Climbing out of my freshly dug grave again, huh? You gotta be more careful with those demons, you know! #speaker:Gravedigger

Yeah, it seems like these demons are more powerful than I anticipated. I don't know if I can handle them, even with the help of this book. #speaker:Prodigy

Well, maybe it's time to upgrade your weapons, my friend. My dad, the blacksmith, might have some tricks up his sleeve. I'll talk to him and make sure he takes it easy on you. #speaker:Gravedigger

Oh, that would be great! I really appreciate your help. I'll go see him as soon as possible.  #speaker:Prodigy

Don't mention it, kid. I just want those demons taken care of so I can have some peace down here. It's about time I catch up on my beauty sleep. #speaker:Gravedigger

I'll do my best, I promise. Thanks again. I'll see you later. #speaker:Prodigy

Take care, prodigy. And make sure to bring some interesting stories back from your little adventure. #speaker:Gravedigger
