Well, I'll be damned. How'd you manage to do that? #speaker:Gravedigger

I honestly have no idea. I remember dying, being surrounded by demons, and then crawling out of that grave. But here I am, alive and kicking. #speaker:Prodigy

Shouldn't you be long dead fighting demons somewhere in the world? That's what I heard, at least. #speaker:Gravedigger

Actually, I still have that book that Annika gave me. And look, it's even glowing! #speaker:Prodigy
 
(smirking) Well, well, well. That book might be the reason for all of this. You should open it and see what it says. #speaker:Gravedigger
